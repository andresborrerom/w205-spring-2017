The range of the score goes from 59.65(%) down to 18.25(%). The selected approach is based on 
giving a score from 0 to 100 for each procedure based on all the hospitals scores and its own
score among them. So if it has the lowest score it has a 0, the top score 100, and if in between, 
it scores on the percentage of the distance from the lowest to top (example: if lowest is 20, 
top is 80, and own score is 65, the score for that procedure is 75%). 

The final score for each hospital is its average on those scores, if it has more than 10 valid scored 
procedures (at least half of the total measures). 

So the hospitals are ranked on their overall situation for each procedure against the other hospitals. 

Top hospitals are slightly on the top half on average, and low ranked hospitals are way below (bottom quartile).
